### How to Use MSNotes

Getting started is simple: add your tasks, assign priorities and deadlines, and then drag them between the different lanes to manage your workflow. You can click on any task to expand or collapse its details. For a more focused view, use the filters to display specific types of tasks. To ensure your data is safe, you can export and import your tasks as a JSON file for backup.

**Helpful Tips:**

*   A red "Immediate Focus" lane is a visual cue that you may be overloaded with tasks.
*   The streak counter is a great way to visualize your consistency with recurring tasks.
*   A "+" symbol next to the total time indicates that some tasks are missing time estimates.
*   Pay attention to the deadline colors, as they will get warmer the more urgent a task becomes.
*   Remember, all of your data remains on your device for complete privacy.
