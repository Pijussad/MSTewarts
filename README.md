# Task Manager

https://notes.mstewarts3.fun/

A simple, local-only task manager. Everything is stored in your browser (LocalStorage). No server, no cloud, no sign-up.

**Features:**
- Three columns: Immediate Focus, Later, Ideas/Long Term
- Color-coded types, priorities, and deadline-based backgrounds
- Recurring tasks, subtasks, drag-and-drop, filtering
- All data stays on your device
- Export/import as JSON for backup

Most usage is intuitive. Just add tasks, drag them, edit inline, and use the filters. For backup, use the export/import buttons.

Built with vanilla JS, Flatpickr, and Inter font. MIT license.
