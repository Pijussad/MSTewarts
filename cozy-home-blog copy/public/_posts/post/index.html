<h2>The Perfect Wind-Down</h2>
<p>After a long day, there's nothing quite as comforting as settling down with a warm cup of tea. It's a ritual that signifies the end of activity and the beginning of peaceful relaxation.</p>
<p>I love a good <strong>Chamomile</strong> for its calming properties, or a hearty <strong>Earl Grey</strong> if I need a little more flavor. The gentle steam rising, the delicate scent, and the warmth in your hands all contribute to that feeling of home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your favorite mug.</li>
<li>Choose your tea.</li>
<li>Boil water.</li>
<li>Steep (don't rush it!).</li>
<li>Find a quiet corner and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's in these small, intentional moments that we truly find our cozy space.</p>
