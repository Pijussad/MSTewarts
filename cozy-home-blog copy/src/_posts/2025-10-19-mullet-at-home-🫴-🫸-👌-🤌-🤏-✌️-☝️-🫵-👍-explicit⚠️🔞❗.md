I﻿ngredients:

* any kind of scissors you have at home 🫵 👍 (we had like those kitchen ones)
* preferably a comb but we didn't have
* hair dye (so sorry we will probably dye)
* p﻿retty client

**S﻿TEP 1:**

F﻿ind a very submissive client who would let you do anything (this shouldn't be too hard)

**S﻿TEP 2:**

S﻿eparate hair into sections, front part (plus take a bit of hair from the back) for bangs, equal sections on both sides for in front of the ear - frame them like curtains around the bangs, and the back.

```

```

I﻿ don't really know how to explain how to do bangs you just kinda do them. Start cutting super small because it will take you a million tries until you get them straight (unless you want them a bit gay which is kind of what we were aiming for) and in the end they will be very short.

I﻿t's very important to get as close to your client as possible, like so:

T﻿his demonstrates trust and strengthens your bond, and it helps you get to all the angles of hair.

**S﻿TEP 3:** LAYERS

T﻿o do layers, you can pull each strand of hair up like this and just cut them in a straight line, this way the above parts will be shorter and and the inner parts longer, but like, evenly, you get the idea.

**S﻿TEP 4:**

C﻿heck if everything's even, and then spend like half an hour "evening it all out" and make the hair super short (this is why it's very important to choose a pretty model who could pull it off even if you fuck it all up).
