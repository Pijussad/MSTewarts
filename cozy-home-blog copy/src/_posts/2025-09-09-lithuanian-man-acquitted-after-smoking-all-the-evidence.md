In a case that left both prosecutors and the public puffing with disbelief, a Lithuanian man accused of stealing thousands of euros worth of cigarettes has been acquitted—because he allegedly *smoked every last one.\
\
Authorities say the 34-year-old suspect was caught on CCTV entering a warehouse in Kaunas late last spring, where he reportedly made off with over 10,000 cigarettes. But when police raided his apartment weeks later, they found no trace of the stolen goods—no cartons, no wrappers, not even a single butt.\
\
“He was chain-smoking like a chimney when we arrived,” said one officer, who asked not to be named. “We thought he was just nervous. Turns out, he may have been destroying the evidence.”\
\
Despite surveillance footage and witness testimony, the court ruled that without physical evidence, the charges could not stick. The man’s lawyer argued that his client had “a very committed nicotine habit” and “simply couldn’t help himself.”\
\
The verdict has sparked debate across Lithuania about the limits of criminal prosecution when the contraband goes up in smoke—literally.\
\
No word yet on whether the man plans to quit smoking, but sources close to him say he’s “considering switching to gum.”
